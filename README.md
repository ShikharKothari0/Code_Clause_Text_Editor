# Code_Clause_Text_Editor
This is a simple Text Editor created by me during my internship at CodeClause using java.<br>
This Text Editor lets us Create, Edit, Save and Print text(.txt) files.<br>
I made this porject using the standard libraries of java.<br>
In this project, we are provided a Text Area on which we are supposed to write the content of our text file.<br>
Here as we are provide with a menu bar on top of the Teat Area. In this menu bar we are provided with 2 drop down options<br>
namely:-<br>
<UL>
    <LI>File</LI>
    <LI>Edit</LI>
</UL><br>
The given Menu Options provide the following actions:-<br>
<UL>
    <LI>File-> </LI>
    <OL>
        <LI>New: Clears the given Text Area for a new file to be written.</LI>
        <LI>Open: Opens a new locally stored text file that is specified by the user by the means of a dialog box.</LI>
        <LI>Save: Creates a new text file locally that contains the contents that is currently written in the Text Area</LI>
        <LI>Print: Opens the print dialog to print the content that is currently written in the Text Area.</LI>
    </OL>
